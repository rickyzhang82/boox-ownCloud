Pull Calibre eBook from ownCloud Server

# Motivation
I bought a Max Carta last week. Everything is great except it didn't fit well with my reading habit. I use Calibre to send weekly Magazine and daily News to my kindle over email. I read it from there.

I'm a native Chinese speaker but use BOOX in English locale. To my surprise, there is a similar send-to-kindle feature in Chinese locale. But it requires you a WeChat account and you must know Chinese. I don't use WeChat and I don't want to the big brother spy on me. So I refuse to use it. In addition, it is not a automate process. You have to login to their account and click button here and there.

Android 4.0 already sucks. The user experiences of running Android app on a single core e-ink tablet irritates me so much that I want to smash this $650 gadget.

In any case, I figure out a way to automate sending process. I have ownCloud server up and running at home. So I share my Calibre library to ownCloud. The hard part is to write a ownCloud client in Android 4.0 that pull eBook periodically from ownCloud server. 

I have tested ownCloud Android library and its Android app on BOOX. I can download files from ownCloud server to BOOX without problem in Android 4.0.
